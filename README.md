Hi there! 👋

I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building web applications. I specialize in JavaScript and typescript and its frameworks and libraries, but I'm always eager to learn new technologies.

My GitHub is where I showcase my personal projects, I believe in the power of open-source software and love contributing to the community.

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, watching anime.

Feel free to check out my work and get in touch! 🤝
